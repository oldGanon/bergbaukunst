A little project started to teach my brother programming in C combined with some game and graphics programming concepts.

I personally use it as a practice project for network programming using sockets for client server communication, parallel programming using threads and SIMD used for software rendering, and understanding and designing noise functions for procedural generation.

Another goal was using minimal dependencies, as such the C standard library is not linked. Microsoft Windows libraries are used to interact with the operating system for window creation, threads, audio, memory, timing, sockets, and user input.
